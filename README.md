# üç∞ Sweet Crumbs Bakery: Organizational Alignment and the 9-S Framework  
*Organizational Alignment through Strategic Analysis*

This repository contains an original, fictional case study analyzing **Sweet Crumbs Bakery**, a boutique cake shop in Johannesburg, through the **9-S Framework** (an extended version of McKinsey‚Äôs 7-S model).  
The analysis explores internal misalignments, structural weaknesses, and growth opportunities as the business scales beyond its first successful year.

## üìò Overview

**Sweet Crumbs Bakery** launched in early 2023 in Rosebank, Johannesburg, blending European-style patisserie designs with South African flavors.  
Despite an energetic start and viral social-media attention, sales declined by late 2024 due to fragmented systems, supply-chain volatility, and high staff turnover.  
This project applies the **9-S Organizational Alignment Model** to diagnose these weaknesses and propose practical, scalable solutions.

## üîç 9-S Diagnostic Summary

| **Structure** | Overlapping roles; no operations manager | Define hierarchy & assign operational authority |
| **Systems** | Manual tools; disconnected POS/inventory | Implement integrated POS & inventory management |
| **Shared Values** | Informal ‚Äúfamily‚Äù culture lacks accountability | Document brand values: *Creativity, Quality, Community* |
| **Style** | Micromanagement by founders | Adopt participative leadership & delegate daily ops |
| **Staff** | High turnover; unclear job expectations | Launch training & incentive programs |
| **Skills** | Dependence on single pastry expert | Cross-train staff; build internal skill bench |
| **Surroundings** | Unreliable suppliers; cost fluctuation | Partner with regional suppliers; stabilize contracts |
