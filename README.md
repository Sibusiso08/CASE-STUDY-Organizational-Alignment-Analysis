# 🍰 Sweet Crumbs Bakery: Organizational Alignment and the 9-S Framework  
*Organizational Alignment through Strategic Analysis*

This repository contains an original, fictional case study analyzing **Sweet Crumbs Bakery**, a boutique cake shop in Johannesburg, through the **9-S Framework** (an extended version of McKinsey’s 7-S model).  
The analysis explores internal misalignments, structural weaknesses, and growth opportunities as the business scales beyond its first successful year.

## 📘 Overview

**Sweet Crumbs Bakery** launched in early 2023 in Rosebank, Johannesburg, blending European-style patisserie designs with South African flavors.  
Despite an energetic start and viral social-media attention, sales declined by late 2024 due to fragmented systems, supply-chain volatility, and high staff turnover.  
This project applies the **9-S Organizational Alignment Model** to diagnose these weaknesses and propose practical, scalable solutions.

## 📊 Key Internal Observations

- **Revenue** fell 28 % in six months despite stable foot traffic.  
- **Staff turnover** reached 35 % within the first year.  
- **Custom-cake sales** (high margin) dropped below 20 % of total revenue.  
- **Manual inventory** tracking led to frequent stockouts.  
- **Customer satisfaction (NPS)** declined from 72 → 56.

## 🔍 9-S Diagnostic Summary

| **Element** | **Key Problem** | **Recommended Action** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Strategy** | No long-term scalability roadmap; reliance on social buzz | Develop 12-month expansion & digital delivery strategy |
| **Structure** | Overlapping roles; no operations manager | Define hierarchy & assign operational authority |
| **Systems** | Manual tools; disconnected POS/inventory | Implement integrated POS & inventory management |
| **Shared Values** | Informal “family” culture lacks accountability | Document brand values: *Creativity, Quality, Community* |
| **Style** | Micromanagement by founders | Adopt participative leadership & delegate daily ops |
| **Staff** | High turnover; unclear job expectations | Launch training & incentive programs |
| **Skills** | Dependence on single pastry expert | Cross-train staff; build internal skill bench |
| **Surroundings** | Unreliable suppliers; cost fluctuation | Partner with regional suppliers; stabilize contracts |
| **Stakeholders** | Weak online & customer engagement | Create loyalty app & structured feedback analytics |
